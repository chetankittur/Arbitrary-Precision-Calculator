# Arbitrary-Precision-Calculator
Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC) implemented in C using doubly linked lists to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on very large integers. Each digit is stored in a node, enabling accurate calculations beyond built-in data type limits with proper carry, borrow, and sign handling.
