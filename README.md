# Arbitrary-Precision-Calculator
The Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC) is a C-based command-line application designed to perform arithmetic operations on very large integers that exceed the limits of standard data types. The project uses doubly linked lists to store each digit of a number, enabling accurate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for numbers of unlimited length. Arithmetic operations are implemented using fundamental algorithms such as carry-based addition, borrow-based subtraction, partial-product multiplication, and repeated-subtraction division. The calculator supports negative numbers, handles edge cases like zero and unequal operand lengths, and demonstrates strong use of data structures, dynamic memory allocation, and modular programming in C.
